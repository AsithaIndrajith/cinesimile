# I want to contribute, but how ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è?

Contributing to CineSimile is simple. CineSimile is developed using ReactJS and IBM Carbon Design System. The following are the pre-requisites to contributing.

1. Knowledge of basic ReactJS
2. Components and modular architecture of a React application.
  
  Don't get intimidated by above line. It means that you have to create seperate components in React and use those in other places. We all know this, but we are not quite familiar with the terminology üòÅ. [This](https://www.simform.com/react-architecture-best-practices/) is a good place to get to know about React Architecture and best practices.
  
3. Basic knowledge in IBM Carbon Design System 

This is not exactly necessary. If you just know how to build a component in HTML, that's all you need to know. However, IBM Carbon Design System is wonderful, it is worth learning. The following resources will be useful if you want to learn about it.

 #### That's it. Now go do something wonderful and send us a pull request.
